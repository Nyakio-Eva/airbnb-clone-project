## Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building a RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.

## Database Design
#### 1. Users
- A user can have many properties (the host)
- A user can have many bookings (the guest)
- A user can make many payments
- A user can write many reviews on different properties
- A user can both book and host 
#### 2. Properties
- A property can have many bookings
- A property can have many reviews
#### 3. Payments
- one payment belongs to one booking
#### 4. Bookings
- one booking belongs to one user
- One booking is for one property
  
#### 5. Reviews
- A user can write one review per property
- A property can have many reviews

 ## Feature Breakdown
 #### 1. API Documentation
 - Ensures  that the backend APIs are well-documented using the OpenAPI standard, making them easy to understand, use, and test.With both Django REST framework and GraohQL, the system offers flexibility for standard CRUD operations and GrapHQL for optimized, custom data queries.
#### 2. User Management
- Allows users to register, login and manage their profiles via endpoints like /users/ and /users/{user_id}. It provides a secure foundation for tracking user-specific actions like bookings, payments and reviews, while enabling role-based access e.g guest vs host
#### 3. Property management
- Through endpoints like /properties/, users (typically hosts) can create, edit, view, or delete property listings. This is the core feature that populates the app’s marketplace, allowing users to browse available places to stay and enabling hosts to manage their offerings.
#### 4. Booking System
- The booking system allows guests to book, update, or cancel reservations through endpoints like /bookings/. It handles check-in/check-out dates, availability validation, and links to both user and property data—forming the transactional heart of the application.
#### 5. Payment processing
- This feature manages the payment workflow, ensuring that guests can securely pay for bookings through the /payments/ endpoint. It handles transactions, links them to specific bookings, and may support future extensions like refunds or payment history.
#### 6. Review System
- Guests can leave ratings and written reviews for properties they've stayed in using endpoints like /reviews/. This feature builds trust and transparency, helping future users make informed decisions and giving hosts valuable feedback.
#### 7. Database Optimization
- To ensure smooth performance at scale, this feature introduces indexing for faster queries and caching mechanisms to minimize repetitive database access. These optimizations contribute significantly to speed, scalability, and user experience, especially under high traffic.

## API Security 
#### 1. Authentication
- Verifies the identity of users before granting access, via JWT tokens or session-based logins.
- This ensures that only the registered users can access sensitive actions like boking a property, viewing their profile, or making payments.
#### 2. Authorization
- Controls what an authenticated user is allowed to do. e.g a guest can't edit another user's booking.
- It prevents privelege escalation and data leaks.
#### 3. Rate limiting
- Limits the number of requests a user or bot can make to the API within a certain timeframe.
- It protects against denial of service (DoS) attacks and brute-force login attempts.
#### 4. Data Validation
- Ensures that user input is properly checked and cleaned before being processed or stored in the database.
- It prevents SQL injection, Cross-site scripting(xss) and other input-based attacks.
#### 5. HTTPS and Secure Communication
- Uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect all data transmitted between clients and the server.
- prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, keeping user credentials, payment info, and personal data safe from interception.
#### 6. Secure Payment Handling
- Uses a trusted third-party payment processor e.g paypal, Stripe, Mpesa rather than handling card details directly.
- It protects both the platform and it's users from credit card fraud and regulatory risks
#### 7. Password Hashing
- Stores user passwords as hashed, not plain text using algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2
- Even if the database is compromised, hashed passwords are hard to reverse.
#### 8. CORS
- Controls which frontend dormains can acces backend resources
- Prevents malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to tje backend on behalf of a logged in user(CSRF-like behavior)
#### 9. Logging and monitoring
- Tracks critical actions and security events such as failed logins, data access attaempts and paymen failures.
- Helps in detecting suspicious activity early and aids in incdent response if a breach occurs.
#### 10. Role-Based Access Control
- Assigns specific permissions based on user roles e.g guest, host, admin
- Helps enforce boundaries and restricts access to sensitive admin features or user data.

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Stands for Continuous Intergration and Continuos Deployment.
- It's a devops practice that automates the process of building, testing and deploying code everytime a change is made
- CI/CD is important for the airbnb clone project because of:
   * Faster Development Cycles – Code changes are integrated and deployed quickly, reducing bottlenecks.
   * Higher Code Quality – Automated tests run with every push, catching bugs early before they hit production.
   * Consistent Deployments – Reduces human error by automating repeatable deployment steps.
   * Better Team Collaboration – Multiple developers can safely push code without breaking the project.
- Common tools for CI/CD:
   * Github Actions: automates tests and deployments on every push or pull requests.
   * Docker: Packages the app into consistent containers for reliable builds and deployment.
   * Docker Compose: Runs multi-conainer setups for local and test environments
   * Heroku/Render/ Railway/AWS/ Azure: cloud platforms where your app can be deployed automatically
   * PostgreSQL: A production ready database used consistently across all environments
